## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `SimConnect::transmit_client_event` has been implemented.  Use `SimConnect::subscribe_to_client_event` to set up the client event(s) prior to using the `SimConnect::transmit_client_event` call.
- Added a few NAV/COM and Transponder related client events.
- Client events are now implemented through `SimConnect::subscribe_to_client_event`, `SimConnect::unsubscribe_from_client_event` and `SimConnect::unsubscribe_from_all_client_events`.
- `subscribe_to_client_events.rs` example has been added.
- `SimConnectError::EventAlreadySubscribedTo` and `SimConnectError::EventNotSubscribedTo` error variants have been added.

### Changed

- A second call to `SimConnect::subscribe_to_system_event` for the same event will now return an error of type `SimConnectError::EventAlreadySubscribedTo` instead of `SimConnectError::SimConnectException`.
- The call to `SimConnect::unsubscribe_from_system_event` is now a NOOP when the system event is not subscribed to.
- `SimConnectError::UnimplementedMessageType` has been renamed to `SimConnectError::UnimplementedNotification`.

### Removed

- `SimConnect::register_event` has been replaced by the new client event functions.
